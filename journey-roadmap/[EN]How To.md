## Exam tips
For each exam, you will find a folder named after the exam, inside which you'll find an [EN]Exam Tips file with some tips and course suggestions.

Additionally, there will be my [EXAM]Personal notes:Anotações file, which provides detailed information about the tips contained in the [EN]Exam Tips file.

## Roadmap suggestion

The folders are numbered, suggesting a roadmap for which exams to take first.

Feel free to complete them in any order you prefer, but note that the Personal Notes follow the suggested order of completion.

> You will notice that the CKAD Personal Notes are much shorter than the KCNA and CKA notes, because most of its content is also covered in the previous ones.
