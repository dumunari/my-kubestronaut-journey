## Exam introduction

KCNA is a very nice introduction to Cloud Native and Kubernetes ecosystem. It takes you from Cloud Native, Linux Foundation and CNCF foundations to a solid basic vision of how Kubernetes works alongside other tools for Observability, Storage, Service Mesh, DevOps and GitOps practices.

You can find the [Exam Topics here](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/kubernetes-cloud-native-associate/).

## What course to take?
For KCNA, I strongly recommend [James Spurin's](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fjamesspurin%2F)  [Kubernetes Certified (KCNA) + Hands On Labs + Practice Exams](https://www.udemy.com/course/dive-into-cloud-native-containers-kubernetes-and-the-kcna/?srsltid=AfmBOooZb6PVZkBkO1fxFovRyuZQ3BZl8CuE6DOzCvkUy062yXyPlYfK&couponCode=KEEPLEARNINGBR) course on Udemy.

James goes through all required topics for KCNA exam with amazing detail.

Also, there are very well prepared HandsOn Labs that helps you applying the theory, while giving you lots of tools to use on the next exams. I truly believe my CKA and CKAD exams.

In the end, you will find some Practice Exams that are pretty aligned with the real exam.
